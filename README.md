## 🧰 Getting Started

### 1. Arduino Setup
- Download and install [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software)
- Install the GRBL firmware:
  - Go to `Sketch > Include Library > Add .ZIP Library`
  - Select `grbl-servo-master.zip` from the `/firmware` folder
- Open `File > Examples > grbl-servo > grblUpload`
- Select your board (Arduino UNO) and upload the sketch

### 2. Preparing the Drawing
- Install [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/)
- Add the extension from `/software/extension_mi_inkscape.zip` to your Inkscape extensions folder:
  - On Windows: `C:\Users\YourName\AppData\Roaming\inkscape\extensions`
- Use Inkscape to create your vector design and export it as G-code

### 3. Sending G-code to the Bot
- Open [Universal G-code Sender](https://winder.github.io/ugs_website/)
- Connect your Arduino via COM port
- Load the `.gcode` file exported from Inkscape
- Click "Send" to start plotting!
